if the file name ends with pyw, then it is a no console file. Its basically just a Python User Interface file. So a Python file that opens up a new Window without the command line.

refer to this link to learn more about pyw extensions (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34739315/pyw-files-in-python-program)

if it is a py file, then it allows you to edit.


Note: To stop a pyw file you need to kill it from task manager or any other. Just end the process by selecting the file
